_Suggestions and Examples of Good BASH scripting practices (IMO)_


We've all heard it (or said it): "`Oh, this is _so_ much better now. It
started out as a BASH script.`" Usually this is for a marginally
usable piece of Python or Ruby.

My shell scripts almost always start out as something I had to type too
many times. And since, when I'm typing one-liners, I like to be as
clever and concise as I can, the first line written is inevitiably
some flash-back inducing pipeline of output and filtering. It's
usually followed by a series of equally crazy steps that eat each
other's output as well. That's perfectly fine place to start.
